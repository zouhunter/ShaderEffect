Thank you downloading!

This package includes a sets of free tessellation shaders.
Please not shaders require DirectX11 (must be supported and enabled).

Included shaders are Legacy (4) and Standard PBS (5) versions  of:

No GPU - does not tessellate on the GPU. May be used to displace dense meshes.
Fixed - tessellation by fixed factor. Always stays the same.  
Distance Based - tessellate by distance. Closer patches get denser.
Edge Length - tessellate based on edge length. Basically a better version of Distance Based.
Smooth - Phong - smooths the surface of an object. Good for making low poly objects smoother.
Smooth Displace - smooths the surface and allows for further displacement.
